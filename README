Create a login page for a console-based banking application in C or C++. The login page should ask a user to enter a username and password. The valid username and password can be hardcoded. Once the user enters the information, a valid user can enter the system. This authentication can be shown in the message that indicates a successful and valid login. Once the application is created, try multiple usernames and passwords to check whether invalid username and password are handled properly.
